Isomorphic application written in React (SOON) 


## Motivation

There are a lot of tutorials and boilerplates showing how to write isomorphic ReactJs applications. 
But when it comes to real world apps, you'll find that all the turorials do not cover problems that you face in productions apps.

In WebbyLab, we have a lot of projects written in react and several isomorphic projects. So, it was decides 
develop one of these projects on github. So, everyone can see how real-world production isomorphic app can be implmemented.

**IMPORTANT**: This is producation app, and we develop it in this repo. So, it is always evolving.


## Solved problems:

1. How to deal with routing?
2. How do we deal with data fetching?
3. How to share the same configuration? (And do not bundle it)
4. How to import css in your react components?  Inline CSS (why not Radium, Material-UI)
5. How to deal with css. It should be loaded before html and splitted out. 
6. Working with history (Invariant Violation: Browser history needs a DOM)
